When you build your app, Xcode compiles your source files and creates an app bundle for your project. An app bundle is a structured directory that contains the code and resources associated with the app. Resources include the image assets, storyboard files, strings files, and app metadata that support your code.

The structure of UIKit apps is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, wherein objects are divided by their purpose. Model objects manage the app’s data and business logic. View objects provide the visual representation of your data. Controller objects act as a bridge between your model and view objects, moving data between them at appropriate times.

UIKit provides most of the objects in the controller and view layers of your app. Specifically, UIKit defines the UIView class, which is usually responsible for displaying your content onscreen. (You can also render content directly to the screen using Metal and other system frameworks.) The UIApplication object runs your app’s main event loop and manages your app’s overall life cycle.
